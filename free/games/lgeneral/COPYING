          Panzer General Data (DOS Version)

The contents of this package is copyrighted by SSI which is now part 
of UBI Soft. I did not receive an answer for a request on whether I 
may use the Panzer General data for LGeneral, which is a non-commercial
product. I assume that no response means, that they don't care about it.
As UBI Soft does not sell this game any longer and as I do not earn any
money with LGeneral, I have made some of the PG resources available for 
download in the spirit of abandonware and to keep a great game alive.

However, if you still sell Panzer General (DOS Version) and think that
financial damage is done to you or if you hold the copyright for this game
and do not want me to publish some of its data, please contact me 
immediately: http://lgames.sf.net/contact.php


You have to use LGC-PG (included to the LGeneral package) to convert
the data. For example, if you have installed LGeneral to the
default path /usr/local/share/games/lgeneral and extracted this data
package to ~/tmp/pg-data, then run (as ROOT)

  lgc-pg -s ~/tmp/pg-data -d /usr/local/share/games/lgeneral

For more information on the converter please see README.lgc-pg from
the source package.
