There is either a bug in makepkg or something very speciall that needs to be done
There is a lne in th pkgbuild that is commented, if you uncomment and build a corrupted
soya pkg will be created it will look ok, but any game dependant on soya will not work 
proparly if at all. a mail detailing this problem was send to the mail-list and i hope
i will get an answer and remove this stupid hack.

meanwhile building the package should be done with "makepkg -o" to download and extract
sources, then manually enteringt the source directory and using "python setup.py build"
and afterward back to the $stardir and "makepkg -e" to build from the exiting source
(without extracting and modifying)

If you want to see what im talking about, or to test wether the bug is still there
just build the package with the way i decribed and backup the created $pkgdir
next uncomment my line in the PKGBUILD and "makepkg -s" to build it
compare if you "md5sum *" on one of the directories that contains files you will 
notice that most of the files are the same but some files like 
"$pkgdir/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/soya/opengl.so" should be different.
if nothing is different then send me a mail to vleon1@gamil.com since it means
either my comp is somehow wrong, or the problem was fixed and this hack
should be removed, do not remove it yourself! mail me and let me confirm this.
